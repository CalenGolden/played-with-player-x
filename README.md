# played-with-player-x

This is a basic python script used to scratch that itch of recognizing a player's name in League of Legends. This is a fun little side project I created after I spent too many games thinking I had played with someone before and not having a reasonable way of checking my recent game history quickly. I am currently working on multiple versions of this script including a JavaScript version applicable as a Discord Bot and potentially an Android app coming in the future as well. The current version of the script requires an API Key from Riot Games. Hopefully, in the future, I will be able to provide a more permanent API Key for users to streamline the application.

## Use Case

1. Get a temporary API Key by going to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and logging in to your league of legends account.
2. Run the script in your favorite terminal.
3. Enter the prompted information (ie. na1, {Your Summoner Name}, {Searched Summoner Name}, {API_KEY})
4. Results!
